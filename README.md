# Test Time Adaptation through externally guided Region Proposal

**Project implementation and report:** [TTA_region_proposal.ipynb](https://github.com/gzemo/TTA-region-proposal/blob/main/TTA_region_proposal.ipynb) 

### Overview
Test Time Adaptation (TTA) is considered to be an out-of-the-box self-supervised procedure. It is expected to enhance Deep Learning model's predictive capability by means of exploitable test set features via an online learning stage by optimizing a pretext task. The purpose of this procedure is to better address the expected test set domain shift by increasing the prediction confidence by "episodic" model parameters update.
To tackle the domain shift problem in the context of image classification two independent Region Proposal (RP) modules had been developed in order to improve the final prediction. A guided search over portions of interest of a given image at test time is provided by means of:
1. an external, intra-image optimization task via **Covariance Matrix Adaptation, Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES)**,
2. a confidence-based region sampling via a prompt based **Zero-shot object detection model (gDINO)**.
This allows us to include the most insightful areas and to further exclude irrelevant portions that may hinder target objects classification.
